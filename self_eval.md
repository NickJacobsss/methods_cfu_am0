# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods?
   * I feel confident with the methods that have been used, but there are a LOT that I haven't seen/used that I will have to learn.
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own?
   * I feel very confident writing basic methods, as it's not something new to me
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!)
   * Methods are capable of anything you write them to do, the world is your oyster. I want to know if there are even more complex methods than the ones listed in the ruby file?
